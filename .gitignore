### How to Fix Your Project (3 Steps)

Please follow these steps exactly:

1.  **Create the File in the Correct Location:**
    * Go to the **root folder** of your project (the main `demo` folder).
    * Create a new file named exactly **`.gitignore`**.
    * Copy the content from the file I created above and paste it into your new `.gitignore` file.

2.  **Untrack the Secret File:**
    * Open your terminal, navigate to your `demo` project folder, and run this command to tell Git to stop tracking the secret file:
        ```bash
        git rm --cached src/main/resources/application-local.properties
        ```

3.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    * Now, commit this change to your repository:
        ```bash
        git add .gitignore
        git commit -m "Add .gitignore and stop tracking local properties"
        git push
