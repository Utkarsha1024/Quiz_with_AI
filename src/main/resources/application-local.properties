# This file is NOT committed to Git. Your secret key lives here.
#
# You are seeing an error because the API key was wrapped in ${...}
# That syntax is for a *variable name*, not the key itself.
#
# --- CHOOSE ONE OF THE OPTIONS BELOW ---

# OPTION 1: Best Practice (Recommended)
# Use this line, and then set an environment variable in your IDE.
# In IntelliJ: Run > Edit Configurations... > Environment variables
# NAME: GEMINI_API_KEY
# VALUE: AIzaSy...your...key...here
#gemini.api.key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}

# OPTION 2: Quick Test (Hard-coded)
# Use this line instead if you don't want to set an environment variable.
# Do NOT wrap the key in ${...}
#
gemini.api.key=AIzaSyCR7PBzsml6q55ONYaPn0-sdNIgI89gszs
