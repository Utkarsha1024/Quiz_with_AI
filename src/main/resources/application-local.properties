# This file is NOT committed to Git. Your secret key lives here.
#
# BEST PRACTICE:
# 1. Remove your key from this file.
# 2. Set an "Environment Variable" on your computer named GEMINI_API_KEY.
# 3. Spring Boot will automatically find it and use it.
#
# In IntelliJ, you can set this in:
# Run > Edit Configurations... > Spring Boot > AiQuizApplication > Environment variables
#
#
# Then, use this line:
gemini.api.key=${AIzaSyCR7PBzsml6q55ONYaPn0-sdNIgI89gszs}

# ---
# For quick testing, you can still hardcode it, but DO NOT commit this file.
# gemini.api.key=AIzaSy...your...key...here
